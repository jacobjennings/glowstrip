# glowstrip
3d printed LED strip diffuser thing for desk.

Modular LED glow strip. Cut a segment of RGB LED strip out, and mount it in this for a nice diffused LED effect. Profile is optimized to avoid shining in your eyes - point the LEDs towards the wall for an ambient effect. Mount to desk with foam tape.

Cut LED strip to desired length, this design is modular and can work with any multiple of 50mm length.


STLs are provided, and a Fusion 360 file is provided as well. The design is fully parameterized if you would like to modify the angle, etc.


100% scale is a tight snap fit for the diffuser. Print diffuser at 99.7% scale for a sliding fit. 


The most typical configuration for a 200mm LED strip clipping would use:
endCapWithSegment
endCapMirrorWithSegment
endCapDiffuser * 2
diffuser * 2


STL files have the parts in ideal printing orientation. Don't bother clipping the supports perfectly neat, you will use foam tape on that surface. Suggest zigzag supports at 20%.


Suggest 1/2in foam mounting tape for a temporary but secure mount to desk:
